This the development version of org-velocity.

There seems to be a split among users of org-velocity between those
who use it for note-taking (myself included) and those who use it for
navigation.

Iâ€™ve tried to address this by giving org-velocity different default
behaviors depending on whether the buffer /being searched/ is also the
/current/ buffer. With the current buffer, we display the innermost headers, narrow to the matching subtrees in the same buffer.
