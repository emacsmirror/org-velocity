This the development version of org-velocity.

** Nav mode

There seems to be a split among users of org-velocity between those
who use it for note-taking (myself included) and those who use it for
navigation.

Iâ€™ve tried to address this by giving org-velocity different default
behaviors depending on whether the buffer /being searched/ is also the
/current/ buffer. With the current buffer, we display the innermost headers, narrow to the matching subtrees in the same buffer.

** Restricting the search

Ido has a feature I find very useful: while searching, you can use
~C-space~ to restrict further searching to the current matches.

This version of org-velocity supports the same feature, also bound to
~C-space~.

(Bear in mind that, for the purposes of creating a new entry, only the
last item searched for is the title for the new entry; restrictions
are not used.)
